# Foo-Lette

Foo-Lette is a basic application designed to help users solve the never ending question of "Where do I want to eat?!". Thousands of people struggle with this question daily and we are here to help by providing users with and randomnly selected restraunt based on their real time location.

Users will need to create an user id and log in to the app. Once in they will simply hit the big green button and have their chosen restraunt displayed.

There are many ideas as how we could grow this simple application such as setting in specific paramaters so restraunts consumers want to avoid don't appear. Storing user preferances and favorite restraunts to make a "Favorites Foo-Lette" and much much more to enhance the user experience.
